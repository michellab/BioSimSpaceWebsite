BioSimSpace.Gateway
===================

The *Gateway* package provides functionality to act as a bridge between
BioSimSpace and the outside world. It allows the user to define robust
and portable workflow components (nodes) that can be run from a variety
of environments, e.g. within `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org>`_, or from
the command-line.
