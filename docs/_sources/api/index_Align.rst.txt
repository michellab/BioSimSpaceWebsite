BioSimSpace.Align
=================
The *Align* package contains tools to select features from MD-trajectories.
It also assigns them to a discrete state space, which will be later used in Markov
modeling.

It supports reading from MD-trajectories, comma separated value ASCII files and 
NumPy arrays. The discretized trajectories are being stored as NumPy arrays of
integers.
