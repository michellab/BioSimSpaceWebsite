`BioSimSpace <https://github.com/michellab/BioSimSpace>`__ is an interoperable
Python framework for biomolecular simulation. With it you can:

* Write robust and portable biomolecular :ref:`workflow components <ref_nodes>` that work on different hardware, with different software packages, and that can be run in different ways, e.g. command-line, `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org>`__.
* Interact with molecular-simulation processes in real time.
